This includes three things:

1) a custom loader which lets you overload code igniter's database drivers

2) a custom database driver for postgresql which allows you to use the superior pg_query_params rather than pg_query in your queries, and a custom profiler overload to take this change into account

3) a custom database driver for mysql which gives you access to "replace into", "insert ignore" and "insert ... on duplicate key"

--------

INSTALL:

* Custom Loader:

1) Copy application/core/MY_Loader.php inside your own application/core directory

You can now overload drivers by putting your own version inside the application/core/ directory (see the provided drivers for example)

* Postgresql driver:

1) Install the custom loader

2) Copy application/core/MY_DB_postgre_driver.php inside your own application/core directory

3) If you want the customized profiler, copy application/libraries/MY_Profiler inside your own application/libraries directory

* Mysql driver:

1) Install the custom loader

2) Copy application/core/MY_DB_mysql_driver.php inside your own application/core directory

--------

USAGE:

See the examples.
